# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This is a basic website template that displays a webpage about QUnit, as well as prints to the console a server side message. It is the general project layout we'll be using for the first half of the semester. 

## Compilation and Running the Program
There are two ways to run this project, first is via the livePreview extension in VSCode, and the second is done via the command line.

Before doing either, please clone (or fork) this repository into a new local directory, then pick one of the options below:
#### Option 1. VSCode
Open the project from the Lab2 folder into VSCode, then run the program via the `run website` option.

#### Option 2. From the command line
First, navigate to your local directory where the project files are stored, then simply enter the following into your terminal: 

`open index.html`

and the website will open in your browser.
Note: the website itself is not hosted on a server, it will be run directly from the local files.
