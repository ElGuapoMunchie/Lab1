# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This is a basic website template that displays a webpage about me! It's our first lab of the semester, and is meant to act as a "getting back into it" project to jog our memories about everything web dev. I chose to use a more "foresty green" color palette for the site, and created a button that displays an alert to the user.

## Compilation and Running the Program
There are two ways to run this project, first is via the livePreview extension in VSCode, and the second is done via the command line.

Before doing either, please clone (or fork) this repository into a new local directory, then pick one of the options below:
#### Option 1. VSCode
Open the project from the Lab2 folder into VSCode, then run the program via the `run website` option.

#### Option 2. From the command line
First, navigate to your local directory where the project files are stored, then simply enter the following into your terminal: 

`open index.html`

and the website will open in your browser.
Note: the website itself is not hosted on a server, it will be run directly from the local files.
