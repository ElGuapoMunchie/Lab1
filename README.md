# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This is a basic website template that displays a webpage about QUnit, as well as prints to the console a server side message. It is the general project layout we'll be using for the first half of the semester. 

## Compilation and Running the Program

First, navigate to your local directory where the project files are stored, then simply enter the following into your terminal: 

`open index.html`

and the website will open in your browser.
Note: the website itself is not hosted on a server, it will be run directly from the local files.

## Sources and Credits
